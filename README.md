Rough categories of things I've done that are on GitHub:

- 🏢 I'm a data engineer at Kami ([@KamiHQ](https://github.com/KamiHQ)). Sometimes I submit PRs to repositories relating to tools that we use.
- 🎓 I was a [graduate student at Stanford](https://czlee.nz/stanford/) from 2013 to 2021. Some of my research projects are in repositories here.
- 🗣️ I was involved in software for debating competitions, most notably [Tabbycat](https://github.com/TabbycatDebate/tabbycat) and [Debatekeeper](https://github.com/czlee/debatekeeper).
- 🌲 A few personal projects are available here, like [elections analysis](https://github.com/czlee/elections) or [Spotify helper scripts](https://github.com/czlee/dynamite).
